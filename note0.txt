1) can't prove a program is elegant (shortest program for given IO) Chaitin, Meta Math, p. 125

2) FsLexYac 7.0.2

3) change fileinfo here in Error.fs (actually line and character are later rewritten inside parser)

let createInfo f l c = FI (f, l, c)

3a) next best place to catch it is here in ...Lib.fs

	let processInput input ctx = 
        let (cmds, _) = parseInput input ctx

	and rewrite

4) need to insert line break at end of file string, if not already present

5) in FileInfo line is 1-based, while character is 0-based (apparrently, but not accurate in displacement)
