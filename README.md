**STOP!**

Read the [Build Notes](http://jackfoxy.github.io/LambdaCalc/buildnotes.html "Build Notes") first.

There is a simple 2-step manual process to make the first build.

# LambdaCalc #

Stripped-down Lambda Calculus parser using fslexyacc. Lexer and parser intended to be as minimalistic as possible, supporting Untyped Lambda Calculus syntax and comments. Also functions as a working interpreter by performing evaluation and reduction.

## UntypedRecurs ##

This lexer/parser program focuses on the bottom and fix (y combinator) abstractions of the Lambda Calculus.
