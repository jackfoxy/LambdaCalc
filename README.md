# LambdaCalc #

Stripped-down lambda calculus parser using fslexyacc. Lexer and parser intended to be as minimalistic as possible, supporting only untyped lambda calculus syntax and comments. Also functions as a working interpreter.

## untypedBottom ##

This lexer/parser program focuses on the bottom and fix (y combinator) abstractions of the lambda calculus.
