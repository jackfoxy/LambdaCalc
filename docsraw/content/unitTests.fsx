Unit Tests
==========

Did you know there is a λ-abstraction you can use as the `assert` statement in unit tests? Actually it is the boolean function on two variables
for equivalence, sometimes known as iff or [xnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNOR_gate).

There are a number of example unit tests [here](https://github.com/jackfoxy/LambdaCalc/tree/master/lambdas/tests).

We have implemented this function abstraction as xnor, and not even in the most efficient manner. Try your hand at developing more efficient implementations. 
You have unit tests to help you.
